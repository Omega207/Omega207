- 👋 Hey there, I’m @Omega207; also known as ΩΛΛΞGΔ!
- 👨‍💻 I’m interested in coding and 3D modeling, as well as making a video game (or a fangame) someday.
- 👾 I’m currently learning C++, JavaScript, and Python. I'm learning Blender for 3D modeling.
- 🖱 I’m looking to work on old projects that aren't maintained anymore, as well as creating/rereleasing some Sonic (fan)games.
- 🔥 Looking forward to getting along with everybody here!
- ‼ NOTE: I do not currently own any social media accounts, like Discord. Do not directly ask me to join because I cannot.
- 🕹 I enjoy Nintendo and SEGA consoles and video games.
