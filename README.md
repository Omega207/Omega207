# ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Iâ€™m @Omega207; also known as Î©Î›Î›ÎžGÎ”!

<br />I'm a to-be developer learning 3D modeling for my projects. I like Sonic the Hedgehog and his franchise, and as a result, I enjoy the communties who love Sonic as well. <br />I also love open source things, so I use Linux as well (despite it not being my main OS: I use Windows instead).

I wish to develop my first ever big project, a Sonic Riders fangame, sometime soon. That is my main reason behind learning Blender.

## Projects:
* Mario Multiverse - Minor spriting
* Coming soon... 

## Learning:
3D Modeling (with Blender)
<br /> Game Development (with Godot, occasionally)
<br /> Coding (soon enough, anyways)
<br /> Digital Music(?)
