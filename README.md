- ğŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m @Omega207!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, as well as making a video game someday.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, and HTML. I look to learn other various languages too (like Java). I use Unity and Unreal for tutorial editors, and Blender for modeling.
- ğŸ–± Iâ€™m looking to work on old projects that aren't maintained anymore, or those that haven't been released in a few years.
- ğŸ“« I hope to get along with everybody here!
