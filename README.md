- ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m @Omega207; also known as Î©Î›Î›ÎžGÎ”!
### â€¼ NOTE: I do **not** currently own any social media accounts, like Discord. Do not directly ask me to join because I cannot.

<br />I'm a to-be developer learning 3D modeling for some projects. I like Sonic the Hedgehog and his franchise, and as a result, I love the communties who love Sonic as well. <br />I also love open source things, so I like Linux as well (despite it not being my main OS: I use Windows instead).

Here's the project I'm working on:
* N/A (Link)

Here are some links to get around and find my stuff:

Thanks and enjoy!
