# 👋 Hey! Omega207!
### Also known as ΩΛΛΞGΔ!

<br />I'm a tech enthusiast and to-be game (and potentially software) developer learning 3D modeling for my projects. I like Sonic the Hedgehog and the fangames made for the franchise. <br />In fact, it's because of those fangames that I've also been inspired to make one myself, though admittedly it's still in the planning stages at the moment. However, I've devoted my time to learning Blender so I can achieve this dream. 

<br />I appreciate open source software, such as Linux and etc.

## Socials:
<br /> You can't find me on social media apps 😃


## Projects:
* Mario Multiverse - Beta Tester
* Coming soon... 

## Learning:
3D Modeling (with Blender)
<br /> Game Development (with Godot, occasionally)
<br /> Coding (soon enough, anyways)
<br /> Digital Music(?)
